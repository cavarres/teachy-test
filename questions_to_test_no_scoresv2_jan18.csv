4,A contractor is designing a play area in a park. The play area's shape is a composite figure formed by a rectangle and a semicircle attached to one of the rectangle's longer sides. The rectangle measures 10 meters in length and 6 meters in width. The semicircle's diameter matches the width of the rectangle. What is the total area of the play area?,"To find the total area of the play area, first calculate the area of the rectangular part and then the area of the semicircular part.

1.  **Area of the rectangle:**
    Length = 10 m
    Width = 6 m
    Area_rectangle = Length × Width = 10 m × 6 m = 60 {{MATH}} \text{m}^2 {{/MATH}}

2.  **Area of the semicircle:**
    The diameter of the semicircle is equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 6 m. Therefore, the radius (r) of the semicircle is half of the diameter.
    Radius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 6 m / 2 = 3 m
    The area of a full circle is {{MATH}} \pi r^2 {{/MATH}}, so the area of a semicircle is {{MATH}} \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 {{/MATH}}.
    Area_semicircle = {{MATH}} \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times (3 \text{ m})^2 {{/MATH}}
    Area_semicircle = {{MATH}} \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times 9 \text{ m}^2 {{/MATH}}
    Area_semicircle = {{MATH}} 4.5 \pi \text{ m}^2 {{/MATH}}

1.  **Area of the large rectangle:**

15,A rectangular garden has an area of 40 square feet. The length of the garden is 2 feet longer than twice its width. Determine the dimensions (length and width) of the garden in feet.,"Let *w* represent the width of the garden in feet.
The length *l* is 1 foot longer than twice its width, so {{MATH}} l = 2w + 1 {{/MATH}}.

The area of a rectangle is given by {{MATH}} A = l \times w {{/MATH}}.
We are given that the area is 56 square feet, so:

{{MATHBLOCK}} w(2w + 1) = 56 2w^2 + w = 56 2w^2 + w - 56 = 0 {{/MATHBLOCK}}

This is a quadratic equation in the form {{MATH}} ax^2 + bx + c = 0 {{/MATH}}, where {{MATH}} a=2, b=1, c=-56 {{/MATH}}.
We use Bhaskara's formula to solve for *w*: {{MATH}} w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} {{/MATH}}.

First, calculate the discriminant {{MATH}} \Delta = b^2 - 4ac {{/MATH}}:

{{MATHBLOCK}} \Delta = (1)^2 - 4(2)(-56) \Delta = 1 - (-448) \Delta = 1 + 448 = 449 {{/MATHBLOCK}}

Now, substitute the values into the formula for *w*:

{{MATHBLOCK}} w = \frac{-(1) \pm \sqrt{449}}{2(2)} w = \frac{-1 \pm 21.1896...}{4} {{/MATHBLOCK}}

We will consider the approximate value for {{MATH}} \sqrt{449} \approx 21.19 {{/MATH}} for calculation, or recognize that {{MATH}} 449 {{/MATH}} is not a perfect square, suggesting integer solutions are not direct for width. Let's recheck the discriminant or assume there might be integer roots or specific instructions for rounding. In standard problems designed for exact solutions, the discriminant usually simplifies.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Sometimes, there might be a typo or a simplification opportunity. Let's try to factorize or use a different approach to ensure it's solvable with common methods.

Let's recheck the calculation of {{MATH}} \Delta = 1^2 - 4(2)(-56) = 1 + 448 = 449 {{/MATH}}. It seems correct.

However, a common practice in these types of problems (High School level) is to have perfect square discriminants for integer solutions. Let's assume there was a slight error in the problem description, or I need to provide the answer with the exact radical.

Given the context of Bhaskara, providing the exact solution is key.

{{MATHBLOCK}} w_1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{449}}{4} w_2 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{449}}{4} {{/MATHBLOCK}}

Since width cannot be negative, we take the positive solution:

{{MATHBLOCK}} w = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{449}}{4} \text{ feet} {{/MATHBLOCK}}

This is approximately {{MATH}} \frac{-1 + 21.1896}{4} \approx \frac{20.1896}{4} \approx 5.0474 {{/MATH}} feet.

Now calculate the length *l*:

{{MATHBLOCK}} l = 2w + 1 = 2\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{449}}{4}\right) + 1 l = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{449}}{2} + 1 l = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{449} + 2}{2} l = \frac{1 + \sqrt{449}}{2} \text{ feet} {{/MATHBLOCK}}

This is approximately {{MATH}} \frac{1 + 21.1896}{2} \approx \frac{22.1896}{2} \approx 11.0948 {{/MATH}} feet.

Let's assume a common scenario where the discriminant is a perfect square for simpler roots. If the problem implies practical integer dimensions, then the numbers used might be different. If the problem expects a solution using Bhaskara's formula directly, then the radical form is the most accurate.

**Self-correction:** The instruction specifies 'practical application' and 'college entrance exam format'. Such exams typically have cleaner numbers or clearly state to leave answers in radical form or round. The original problem description might imply integer or simple fractional solutions. Let's adjust the numbers in the problem statement for cleaner results.

Let's re-imagine the problem such that the discriminant is a perfect square.
If Area = 40, Length = 2w+2
{{MATH}} w(2w+2) = 40 \implies 2w^2 + 2w - 40 = 0 \implies w^2 + w - 20 = 0 {{/MATH}}
Here, {{MATH}} \Delta = 1^2 - 4(1)(-20) = 1 + 80 = 81 {{/MATH}} (perfect square).
{{MATH}} w = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm 9}{2} {{/MATH}}.
{{MATH}} w_1 = \frac{-1+9}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 {{/MATH}}.
{{MATH}} w_2 = \frac{-1-9}{2} = \frac{-10}{2} = -5 {{/MATH}} (discard negative).
So, width = 4 feet. Length = {{MATH}} 2(4) + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10 {{/MATH}} feet.
This gives a length of 10 feet and a width of 4 feet.

Okay, I will change the original problem statement to yield integer solutions, as it's more typical for this level of practical application in college entrance exams unless explicitly asked for radical form.

Revised problem: A rectangular garden has an area of 40 square feet. The length of the garden is 2 feet longer than twice its width. Determine the dimensions (length and width) of the garden in feet.

Revised Solution:
Let *w* represent the width of the garden in feet.
The length *l* is 2 feet longer than twice its width, so {{MATH}} l = 2w + 2 {{/MATH}}.

The area of a rectangle is given by {{MATH}} A = l \times w {{/MATH}}.
We are given that the area is 40 square feet, so:

{{MATHBLOCK}} w(2w + 2) = 40 2w^2 + 2w = 40 2w^2 + 2w - 40 = 0 {{/MATHBLOCK}}

Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:

{{MATHBLOCK}} w^2 + w - 20 = 0 {{/MATHBLOCK}}

This is a quadratic equation in the form {{MATH}} ax^2 + bx + c = 0 {{/MATH}}, where {{MATH}} a=1, b=1, c=-20 {{/MATH}}.
We use Bhaskara's formula to solve for *w*: {{MATH}} w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} {{/MATH}}.

First, calculate the discriminant {{MATH}} \Delta = b^2 - 4ac {{/MATH}}:

{{MATHBLOCK}} \Delta = (1)^2 - 4(1)(-20) \Delta = 1 - (-80) \Delta = 1 + 80 = 81 {{/MATHBLOCK}}

Now, substitute the values into the formula for *w*:

{{MATHBLOCK}} w = \frac{-(1) \pm \sqrt{81}}{2(1)} w = \frac{-1 \pm 9}{2} {{/MATHBLOCK}}

Two possible solutions for *w*:

{{MATHBLOCK}} w_1 = \frac{-1 + 9}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 w_2 = \frac{-1 - 9}{2} = \frac{-10}{2} = -5 {{/MATHBLOCK}}

Since the width of a garden cannot be negative, we discard {{MATH}} w_2 = -5 {{/MATH}}.
So, the width of the garden is {{MATH}} w = 4 {{/MATH}} feet.

Now, calculate the length *l* using the relationship {{MATH}} l = 2w + 2 {{/MATH}}:

{{MATHBLOCK}} l = 2(4) + 2 l = 8 + 2 l = 10 {{/MATH}} {{/MATHBLOCK}}

So, the length of the garden is 10 feet.
