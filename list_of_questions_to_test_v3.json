O poeta parnasiano era 'impass\u00edvel', mantendo um distanciamento emocional em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao objeto do poema, focando na descri\u00e7\u00e3o e na observa\u00e7\u00e3o, sem a interfer\u00eancia de sentimentos pessoais.\n\n2.  **Perfei\u00e7\u00e3o Formal e Rigor M\u00e9trico:** O Parnasianismo era obcecado pela perfei\u00e7\u00e3o da forma. Isso se manifestava no uso de estruturas po\u00e9ticas r\u00edgidas, como o soneto, na contagem rigorosa de s\u00edlabas po\u00e9ticas (m\u00e9trica), na escolha de rimas ricas e na busca por uma linguagem polida e erudita. O Romantismo, por sua vez, privilegiava a liberdade formal, utilizando versos brancos ou livres e estruturas menos r\u00edgidas para melhor expressar a espontaneidade dos sentimentos.",

This method aimed to control public perception and legitimize the regime.\n2. **Suppression of civil society organizations:** Dictatorships systematically dismantled or co-opted independent organizations such as labor unions, student federations, and political parties. In Argentina during the military juntas (1976-1983), independent labor unions were banned, their leaders often 'disappeared,' and political parties were outlawed, effectively removing platforms for organized opposition and dissent.",

These regimes were often viewed as stable bulwarks against leftist movements, which the U.S. perceived as Soviet-backed threats. The stated goal was to protect U.S. interests and regional stability.\n\nHowever, the long-term impact of this support on democratic development was largely detrimental. U.S. backing often entrenched authoritarian leaders, enabling them to suppress democratic institutions, violate human rights with impunity, and stifle nascent democratic movements. This support delayed genuine democratic transitions, fostered deep-seated anti-American sentiment among populations suffering under these dictatorships, and created a legacy of political instability and human rights abuses that continued to challenge democratic consolidation long after the Cold War ended. The U.S. prioritization of anti-communism often came at the expense of promoting democratic values.",

Their widespread demonstrations and calls for reform, though brutally suppressed in the Tlatelolco Massacre, significantly heightened public consciousness regarding government repression and became a pivotal moment in Mexico's eventual, albeit slow, democratic transition.",

This expansion directly contributes to a significant portion of global sea level rise. Additionally, the melting of glaciers and ice sheets (also a physical process linked to warming) adds more water to the oceans.\n\n2.  **Subsidence due to Groundwater Extraction (Human Geography):** In many coastal cities, excessive pumping of groundwater for urban and agricultural use can cause the land surface to compact and sink, a process known as subsidence. This effectively lowers the elevation of the land relative to sea level, exacerbating the impacts of rising sea levels and making coastal areas more vulnerable to storm surges even if the water level itself hasn't risen significantly.",

          "question_solution": "A sustainable geographic strategy this community could implement is **managed aquifer recharge (MAR)**. This involves actively replenishing the aquifer with water, often from surface sources (like rivers during periods of higher flow, or treated wastewater), through infiltration basins, injection wells, or other methods. This strategy directly addresses the challenge of a dropping water table by: \n1.  **Increasing Supply:** It augments the natural recharge rate, ensuring more water enters the aquifer than would occur naturally, especially during drought conditions. \n2.  **Mitigating Over-extraction:** By consciously adding water back, the community can offset the water being drawn out, maintaining a healthier balance in the aquifer. \n3.  **Improving Water Quality:** In some MAR applications, the natural filtration properties of the ground can improve the quality of the recharged water. This approach moves beyond simply reducing consumption (which is also important) to actively managing the resource's quantity.",

Ensuring minority rights also preserves the potential for today's minority to become tomorrow's majority and for diverse ideas to contribute to a robust public sphere.

          "question_solution": "The Roman philosophy of 'Mens sana in corpore sano' emphasized the interconnectedness of physical and mental health. While the Romans themselves often focused physical activity on military training or spectacle, this aphorism articulated a fundamental principle. During the Renaissance, this concept was revived and became influential in shaping the educational ideals that included physical training. Renaissance humanists, looking back to classical antiquity, integrated this idea into their educational theories, advocating for a balanced curriculum that developed both intellectual and physical capabilities. This move signaled a departure from the purely spiritual focus of the Middle Ages and laid groundwork for modern physical education by recognizing the role of physical well-being in overall human development and learning.",

How did their progressive ideas alter the traditional militaristic or calisthenics-focused approaches?",
          "question_solution": "Early 20th-century reformers like Thomas Wood and Rosalind Cassidy were instrumental in shifting Physical Education away from purely militaristic drills, rote calisthenics, or fragmented body-part exercises. Their progressive ideas emphasized a more holistic approach, focusing on the child's developmental needs, individual interests, and social growth. They advocated for 'education through the physical,' where physical activities and sports were used as tools to develop character, sportsmanship, cooperation, and democratic ideals, not just physical strength or military readiness. This led to curriculum designs that included varied activities, games, and team sports aimed at comprehensive development, making physical education more engaging and purposeful beyond simple physical training.",

As the rod moves, the area enclosed by a hypothetical circuit involving the rod changes, causing a change in the magnetic flux through that area. According to Faraday's Law, a changing magnetic flux induces an EMF. In this specific case, the change in flux {{MATH}} d\\Phi = B (L dx) {{/MATH}}, where {{MATH}} dx = v dt {{/MATH}}. So, {{MATH}} \\frac{d\\Phi}{dt} = B L \\frac{dx}{dt} = B L v {{/MATH}}. The induced potential difference across the ends of the rod is precisely this rate of change of magnetic flux per unit time, often referred to as motional EMF. Therefore, the induced potential difference of {{MATH}} B L v {{/MATH}} is the rate at which magnetic flux is being 'swept' by the moving conductor.",

If the goal is to maximize the braking force, which adjustable parameter related to magnetic flux should the technician prioritize, and why?",
          "question_solution": "The braking force in an electromagnetic braking system arises from eddy currents induced in the conducting plate as it moves through the magnetic field. According to Faraday's Law, these eddy currents are produced due to a change in magnetic flux through the plate.\n\nThe magnitude of the induced electromotive force (EMF) and consequently the eddy currents is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux ({{MATH}} \\frac{d\\Phi}{dt} {{/MATH}}). The magnetic flux {{MATH}} \\Phi {{/MATH}} is given by {{MATH}} \\Phi = B A \\cos\\theta {{/MATH}}, where B is the magnetic field strength, A is the area of the plate cutting the flux, and {{MATH}} \\theta {{/MATH}} is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the plate's surface. When the plate moves, it effectively changes the area 'A' cutting the field or moves into/out of regions of different 'B' or '{{MATH}} \\theta {{/MATH}}'.\n\nTo maximize the braking force, the technician needs to maximize the induced eddy currents, which in turn means maximizing the induced EMF. This can be achieved by maximizing the rate of change of magnetic flux.\n\nThe key adjustable parameter to prioritize for maximizing the *rate* of change of magnetic flux is the **strength of the magnetic field (B)**. While the area (A) and velocity (v, which impacts the rate of area change or flux cutting) are also important, increasing B directly leads to a proportional increase in the magnetic flux for a given area, and thus a larger rate of change of flux if other factors like velocity are constant. A stronger magnetic field will induce larger eddy currents for the same relative motion, resulting in a greater braking force (Lenz's Law ensures the induced force opposes the motion).\n\nOther factors like the speed of the plate and the effective area interacting with the field are also crucial, but the magnetic field strength offers a fundamental way to amplify the flux change for any given mechanical configuration.",

          "question_statement": "Imagine a simple DC motor where the rotating coil is connected to a power source. When the motor is first turned on, the current flowing through its coil is very high. As the motor speeds up, the current decreases significantly. Using the concept of magnetic flux, explain why this change in current occurs.",
          "question_solution": "When a DC motor is first turned on, the coil is stationary or moving very slowly. At this point, the magnetic flux through the coil due to the external magnetic field (from permanent magnets or electromagnets in the motor) is either constant or changing very slowly if the coil starts from rest. However, as the coil begins to rotate, it cuts through the magnetic field lines, causing the magnetic flux through the coil to change.\n\nAccording to Faraday's Law of Induction, a change in magnetic flux through a coil induces an electromotive force (EMF). This induced EMF is often called **back EMF** (or counter EMF) in a motor because, by Lenz's Law, its direction opposes the change in flux that caused it. Since the coil's rotation is driven by the external power supply, the back EMF opposes the applied voltage from the power source.\n\nInitially, when the motor is just starting, the coil's rotational speed (and thus the rate of change of magnetic flux) is low, so the back EMF generated is small. Consequently, the net voltage across the coil (applied voltage - back EMF) is high, leading to a large initial current according to Ohm's Law ({{MATH}} I = V_{\\text{net}} / R {{/MATH}}). \n\nAs the motor speeds up, the rate at which the coil cuts magnetic field lines increases, causing a larger rate of change of magnetic flux ({{MATH}} d\\Phi/dt {{/MATH}}). This leads to a significant increase in the induced back EMF. Since the back EMF opposes the applied voltage, the net voltage across the coil decreases. With a lower net voltage across the coil's resistance, the current flowing through the coil decreases, even though the motor is operating at a higher speed. This back EMF plays a crucial role in regulating the motor's speed and preventing excessive current flow at higher speeds.",

          "question_solution": "When a metallic ring is dropped through a localized magnetic field, its interaction can be divided into three phases based on the change in magnetic flux:\n\n1.  **Entering the magnetic field:** As the top edge of the metallic ring first enters the magnetic field, the magnetic flux through the ring begins to increase. Before entering, the flux was zero; as it enters, the area of the ring exposed to the field increases, leading to an increasing downward magnetic flux (assuming the field points downwards). According to Faraday's Law, this change in flux induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the ring, which drives an induced current. By Lenz's Law, the direction of this induced current will create a magnetic field that opposes the *increase* in the downward flux. This typically results in an upward magnetic force on the ring, opposing its downward motion. Therefore, the ring experiences a braking effect, slowing its fall.\n\n2.  **Passing completely through the uniform magnetic field:** Once the entire ring is inside the uniform magnetic field and moving at a constant velocity, the magnetic flux through the ring becomes constant. Assuming the field is uniform over the ring's extent, there is no change in the magnetic flux ({{MATH}} \\Delta\\Phi = 0 {{/MATH}}). Consequently, according to Faraday's Law, no EMF is induced, and no induced current flows through the ring. During this phase, the ring falls freely under gravity, unaffected by the magnetic field (assuming no other forces like air resistance).\n\n3.  **Exiting the magnetic field:** As the bottom edge of the metallic ring begins to leave the magnetic field, the magnetic flux through the ring starts to decrease. The area of the ring exposed to the field diminishes, leading to a decreasing downward magnetic flux. Again, Faraday's Law dictates that an EMF is induced, creating a current. By Lenz's Law, the induced current's magnetic field will now act to oppose the *decrease* in the downward flux. This requires the induced magnetic field to be in the downward direction, which again results in an upward magnetic force on the ring, opposing its motion. The ring experiences another braking effect, slowing down as it exits the field.\n\nIn summary, the ring's motion is slowed down (experiences magnetic braking) both when entering and exiting the magnetic field due to induced eddy currents and the associated magnetic forces opposing the change in magnetic flux. It falls freely when entirely within a uniform magnetic field.",

According to Faraday's Law, an EMF is induced, and by Lenz's Law, an induced current will flow in a direction that creates a magnetic field opposing the increase in flux. This typically results in a counter-clockwise or clockwise current depending on the field direction, creating a force that opposes the ring's downward motion. \n2.  **Fully inside the field**: When the entire ring is moving within the uniform magnetic field, the magnetic flux through the ring remains constant because the area of the loop within the field and the field strength do not change. Therefore, according to Faraday's Law, no EMF is induced, and consequently, no induced current flows through the ring. \n3.  **Exiting the field**: As the bottom part of the ring exits the magnetic field, the magnetic flux through the ring decreases (since the area within the field decreases). By Faraday's Law, an EMF is induced. By Lenz's Law, the induced current will flow in a direction that creates a magnetic field to oppose this decrease in flux, meaning it will try to maintain the original flux direction.

As the permanent magnet moves back and forth, the magnetic field lines passing through the coil (i.e., the magnetic flux) continuously change. When the magnet moves closer, the magnetic flux through the coil increases; when it moves away, the magnetic flux decreases. Faraday's Law states that an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in a circuit whenever there is a change in the magnetic flux linking the circuit over time.

However, the given total acceleration ({{MATH}} a_{total} {{/MATH}}) is {{MATH}} 5.0 \\text{ m/s}^2 {{/MATH}}. This indicates a logical inconsistency in the problem statement as {{MATH}} a_c {{/MATH}} (8.0 m/s^2) cannot be less than {{MATH}} a_{total} {{/MATH}} (5.0 m/s^2) if tangential acceleration is real. Let me re-evaluate the question with more realistic numbers. \n\nLet's assume the speed is {{MATH}} 3.0 \\text{ m/s} {{/MATH}} and radius is {{MATH}} 2.0 \\text{ m} {{/MATH}}. Then {{MATH}} a_c = \\frac{(3.0 \\text{ m/s})^2}{2.0 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{9.0}{2.0} = 4.5 \\text{ m/s}^2 {{/MATH}}. \nIf the total acceleration is {{MATH}} 5.0 \\text{ m/s}^2 {{/MATH}}, we use {{MATH}} a_{total}^2 = a_t^2 + a_c^2 {{/MATH}}. \nSo, {{MATH}} (5.0 \\text{ m/s}^2)^2 = a_t^2 + (4.5 \\text{ m/s}^2)^2 {{/MATH}}. \n{{MATH}} 25.0 = a_t^2 + 20.25 {{/MATH}}. \n{{MATH}} a_t^2 = 25.0 - 20.25 = 4.75 {{/MATH}}. \n{{MATH}} a_t = \\sqrt{4.75} \\approx 2.18 \\text{ m/s}^2 {{/MATH}}. \n\nLet's use the original numbers and ensure the distractors are consistent. The centripetal acceleration is {{MATH}} a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r} = \\frac{(4.0 \\text{ m/s})^2}{2.0 \\text{ m}} = 8.0 \\text{ m/s}^2 {{/MATH}}. The total acceleration is {{MATH}} a_{total} = 5.0 \\text{ m/s}^2 {{/MATH}}. This means the total acceleration is *less* than the centripetal acceleration, which is physically impossible as {{MATH}} a_{total} = \\sqrt{a_t^2 + a_c^2} {{/MATH}} implies {{MATH}} a_{total} \\ge a_c {{/MATH}}. \n\n**Correction**: I need to re-think the numbers in the question to make it physically possible. Let's make the total acceleration greater than the calculated centripetal acceleration. \n\nNew scenario: An object moves in a circular path with an increasing speed.

If the magnitude of its total acceleration is {{MATH}} 10.0 \\text{ m/s}^2 {{/MATH}}, what is the magnitude of its tangential acceleration? \n\nNow, {{MATH}} a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r} = \\frac{(4.0 \\text{ m/s})^2}{2.0 \\text{ m}} = 8.0 \\text{ m/s}^2 {{/MATH}}. \n{{MATH}} a_{total}^2 = a_t^2 + a_c^2 {{/MATH}}. \n{{MATH}} (10.0 \\text{ m/s}^2)^2 = a_t^2 + (8.0 \\text{ m/s}^2)^2 {{/MATH}}. \n{{MATH}} 100.0 = a_t^2 + 64.0 {{/MATH}}. \n{{MATH}} a_t^2 = 100.0 - 64.0 = 36.0 {{/MATH}}. \n{{MATH}} a_t = \\sqrt{36.0} = 6.0 \\text{ m/s}^2 {{/MATH}}.\n\nThis is a valid and challenging medium-level question for 10th grade.
